# Prescripto 🩺 | My Practice Project

**A full-stack doctor booking platform built for learning purposes**

**Prescripto** is my practice project to learn full-stack development by building a complete healthcare appointment system. While not a production-ready application, it demonstrates core web development concepts and modern tech stack implementation.

## 🌟 Why I Built This
- To practice the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- To understand complex state management with React
- To implement real-world features like authentication and booking systems
- To learn best practices in code organization and project structure

## 🛠️ Practice Highlights
**Implemented Features:**
- JWT authentication system 🔑
- Appointment scheduling with conflict checking ⏰
- Doctor search with filters (specialization, availability) 🔍
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS 💅
- Error handling and form validation 🚨

**Technical Challenges Overcome:**
- State synchronization between frontend and backend
- Calendar slot management logic
- Role-based routing (Patient/Doctor/Admin)
- File upload for medical documents
- Deployment configuration for full-stack app

## 🧑💻 For Fellow Learners
This project helped me understand:
- How to structure medium-complexity applications
- Importance of proper API documentation
- Effective error handling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
